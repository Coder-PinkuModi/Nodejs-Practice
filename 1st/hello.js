// This will introduce u with nodejs runtime environment--
// Hi there remember that in nodejs u are not getting the feature of windows object that is DOM manipulation is not possible with nodejs environment in terminal

// Remember:- Adding comments in json file is not allowed, so to make it simple for client side server-- hence if we have to write any comment for such specific thing then will follow the (main).js file for reference

// Going to add script in in script key of the package.json will automatically start the particular file like hello.js(after "test" sctript) by running the script inside it
